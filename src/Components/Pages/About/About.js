                The Central Florida Sighthound Racing Club was formed in 2015 by
                Ron and Cheryl Bigford. Pat Moran was the first President. Ron
                wanted an additional format for his whippets to run and perform
                that was not judged. The first format the Club raced was the
                Straight WRA (Whippet Racing Association) format of 200yrds. The
                LGRA (Large Gazehound Racing Association) format was added
                later. The Club raced at the Sanctuary for the first couple of
                years and later hosted events at the Florida Horse Park.

                The NOTRA (National Oval Track Racing Association) format was
                added with the new venue. In 2018 two sand tracks were built at
                the FHP for racing on sand. Sand is considered the best surface
                for dogs to race on since there are less injuries. In late 2018
                the Florida Amendment to end Greyhounds racing for betting
                purposes led to some confusion and the later part 2019 the Club
                was looking for another venue. By the beginning of 2020
                Greyhound racing ended and the FHP allowed the Club to resume a
                smaller scale program. The Club is always looking to expand the
                racing formats and new formats will be added with the idea of
                expanding the entries for events to a broader group of eligible
                racers.
